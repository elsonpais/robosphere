          <h3>1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h3>
          <p>
            To streamline business processes and reduce costs, more CIOs are
            turning to an evolving technology practice called Robotic Process
            Automation (RPA). With RPA, organizations can automate rule-based
            tedious business processes, allowing their workforce to devote more
            time to serving clients or other higher-value work. RPA is aimed at
            the automation of business processes, governed by business logic and
            organized inputs. RPA solutions can range from something as easy as
            producing an automated email response to deploying thousands of
            bots, each programmed in an ERP system to automate rule-based tasks.
            RPA is being implemented across industry verticals like
            manufacturing, KPO, HR, and finance.

          <h3>2. Conversational AI</h3>
          <p>
            AI-powered chatbots, also known as Conversational AI, enhance the
            customer experience’s reach, responsiveness, and personalization.
            According to Forrester, conversational AI solutions transform into
            better automation of customer service. To better understand what the
            human says and needs, an AI-powered chatbot uses natural language
            processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide a more natural,
            near-human-level interaction.

          <h3>3. The role of AI in Healthcare</h3>
          <p>
            Big Data has been extensively used to identify COVID patients and
            critical hot points. AI is already helping the healthcare sector to
            a great degree with high accuracy. Besides, researchers have
            developed thermal cameras and mobile applications to monitor
            individual temperatures and to collect data for healthcare
            organizations. By leveraging data analysis and predicting various
            outcomes, AI can support healthcare facilities in several unique
            ways. AI and ML instruments offer insights into human health and
            also recommend preventive steps to avoid the spread of diseases. AI
            solutions also help doctors remotely track the health of their
            patients, thereby advancing teleconsultation and remote care.

          />
          <h3>4. Increase in demand for ethical AI</h3>
          <p>
            There is a growing demand for ethical AI and it is at the top of the
            list of emerging developments in technology. The next decade,
            according to Forrester, will require CIOs to both respond to digital
            acceleration and proactively handle uncertainty and business
            continuity with the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence. Looking
            at how trends are rapidly changing, values-based customers and
            workers expect businesses to implement AI responsibly. Companies
            will actively choose to do business with partners committed to data
            ethics in the next few years.

          <h3>5. AI for Cybersecurity and knowledge breach</h3>
          <p>
            In the coming years, knowledge will grow to be extra accessible, and
            digital data will be at greater risk of being compromised and
            exposed to hacking and phishing attacks. AI and emerging technology
            will provide the security department with support in every area
            against malicious activities. AI will help deter cybercrimes in the
            future with improved cybersecurity measures. Fake digital activity
            or transactions that match criminal trends will be detected by the
            AI-enabled framework.

          <h3>1. Small Data and TinyML</h3>
          <p>
            The rapid growth in the amount of digital data that we are
            generating, collecting, and analyzing is often referred to as Big
            Data. It isn’t just the data that’s big, though – the ML algorithms
            we use to process it can be quite big, too. GPT-3, the largest and
            most complicated system capable of modeling human language, is made
            up of around 175 billion parameters.

          />
          <h3>2. Data-driven Customer Experience</h3>
          <p>
            This is about how businesses take our data and use it to provide us
            with increasingly worthwhile, valuable, or enjoyable experiences.
            This could mean cutting down friction and hassle in e-commerce, more
            user-friendly interfaces and front-ends in the software we use, or
            spending less time on hold and being transferred between different
            departments when we make a customer service contact.

          />
          <h3>3. Deepfakes, generative AI, and synthetic data</h3>
          <p>
            This year many of us were tricked into believing Tom Cruise had
            started posting on TikTok when scarily realistic “deepfake” videos
            went viral. The technology behind this is known as generative AI, as
            it aims to generate or create something – in this case, Tom Cruise
            regaling us with tales of meeting Mikhail Gorbachev – that doesn’t
            exist in reality. Generative AI has quickly become embedded in the
            arts, and entertainment industry, where we have seen Martin Scorsese
            de-age Robert DeNiro in The Irishman and (spoiler alert) a young
            Mark Hamill appear in The Mandalorian.

          />
          <h3>4. Convergence</h3>
          <p>
            AI, the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and superfast
            networks like 5G are the cornerstones of digital transformation, and
            data is the fuel they all burn to create results. All of these
            technologies exist separately, but combined; they enable each other
            to do much more. Artificial intelligence enables IoT devices to act
            smart, interacting with each other with as little need for human
            interference as possible – driving a wave of automation and the
            creation of smart homes and smart factories, all the way up to smart
            cities. 5G and other ultra-fast networks don't just allow data to be
            transmitted at higher speeds; they will enable new types of data
            transfer to become commonplace (just as superfast broadband and 3G
            made mobile video streaming an everyday reality) and AI algorithms
            created by data scientists play a key role in this, from routing
            traffic to ensure optimal transfer speeds to automating
            environmental controls in cloud data centers. In 2022, an increasing
            amount of exciting data science work will take place at the
            intersection of these transformative technologies, ensuring they
            augment each other and play nicely together.

          <h3>5. AutoML</h3>
          <p>
            Short for "automated machine learning," AutoML is an exciting trend
            that's driving the "democratization" of data science mentioned in
            the introduction to this piece. Developers of autoML solutions aim
            to create tools and platforms that can be used by anyone to create
            their own ML apps. In particular, it’s aimed at subject matter
            experts whose specialized expertise and insights make them ideally
            placed to develop solutions to the most pressing problems in their
            particular fields but who often lack the coding knowledge needed to
            apply AI to those problems.

          <h3>1. The Intersection Of ML and IoT</h3>
          <p>
            IoT is already an established technology wherein multiple devices or
            “things” are connected across a network and they can communicate
            with each other. These devices are increasing continually, so much
            so that there might be more than 64 billion IoT devices by 2025. All
            these devices collect data that can be analyzed and studied to
            obtain useful insights. That’s where Machine Learning becomes so
            important! Machine Learning algorithms can be used to convert the
            data collected by IoT devices into useful actionable results.

          />
          <h3>2. Automated Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            The next stage of development in Machine Learning is Automated
            Machine Learning! It’s a godsend for people who are not experts in
            the complicated world of Machine Learning and also for experienced
            data scientists and analysts. Automated Machine Learning allows
            these data scientists to create Machine Learning models with higher
            efficiency and productivity while having top-notch quality.

          <h3>3. Machine Learning in Cyber Security</h3>
          <p>
            As Machine Learning becomes more and more popular in current times,
            it is also increasing its applications in many different industries.
            One of the most popular among them is the Cyber Security industry.
            Machine Learning has many applications in Cyber Security including
            improving available antivirus software, fighting cyber-crime that
            also uses Machine Learning capabilities, identifying cyber threats,
            and so on.

          <h3>4. Rise of AI Ethics</h3>
          <p>
            Now that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is on the
            rise, it is equally important to discuss the ethics of these
            technologies. It is very easy to create tech that is intelligent and
            has independent thinking capabilities but what happens after? What
            if a self-driving car kills a person? What if a Machine Learning
            algorithm is biased towards certain people because the data is
            biased? Should robots have any rights under the law or not? What
            will happen to people’s jobs if Machine Learning becomes more
            widespread? These are all Ethics questions that are important and
            need to be discussed more in 2021.

          <h3>5. AI Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone has heard about software engineering, but now it’s AI
            Engineering that on the rise as a profession! This is a very
            important development because the integration of Artificial
            Intelligence and Machine Learning in the industry has been very
            ad-hoc and haphazard without any regulations of best practices.
            That’s why Gartner even predicts that only 53% of AI and ML projects
            complete the journey from a prototype to full production in a
            company while the rest 47% face failure.
